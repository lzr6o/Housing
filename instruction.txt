Thank you so much again for giving me this interview chance!

Below are a few bit instructions about how to run my program.

You can run my program on eclipse or best (SpringToolSuit ^.^)

I used MySQL as my database, I have included a data.sql file in my project, you could just run the script and get all the test data imported!

For all the API calls I have also attached some Postman screenshots of the results I got!

Hope you enjoy my program and if you have any questions for me, just call me at 212-3210453 or send me an email at zr6oli@gmail.com

I really hope I can join the team and contribute more to the code HAHA ^.^

Best Regards
Zhengrui Li
